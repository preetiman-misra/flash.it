# Flash.it

> IN PROGRESS

`Flash.it` is a simple web application to manage your flashcards. It can help you -

1. Create flashcard decks
2. Group multiple decks into topics
3. Share your decks with a simple link

And many more features to come.

## Purpose

The goal behind this project for me is to familiairize myself with Svelte, a framework I am pretty excited
to learn and use in production-grade projects.

## Roadmap

Currently I am building `Flash.it` at a relaxed pace in order to learn Svelte and all it has to offer thoroughly. This is more of a learning/progress tracker for me rather than a serious project that I want ot push to production, even though I want the application to be resilient enough to handle production workloads.
